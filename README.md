# gAxis

Pre styled centralised repository of axis for use with the FT's g-chartframe architecture as part of the Visual Vocabulary. Creates ordinal, linear or date axis that can be appended to the .plot obejct in the g-chartframe hopefully eliminating the need to code another standard axis or set up the tick format for a date sequence.

Will also work with other builds where the axis is called into an svg.
